              <p>
                Career Studio (&ldquo;we&rdquo;, &ldquo;us&rdquo;) is a Sri Lanka-based career
                technology platform. We operate <code>careerstudio.lk</code> and the associated
                career tools (ATS Checker, CV Builder, LinkedIn Optimizer, Career GPS, Cover
                Letter Writer, Graphical CV Builder, Talent Pool).
              </p>
            </Section>

            <Section title="2. What we collect">
              <p>We collect three categories of data, each for an explicit purpose:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
                <li>
                  <strong>Account data</strong> — name, email, password hash (or Google OAuth
                  identifier), preferred locale. Required to sign you in.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Content data</strong> — resumes, cover letters, ATS scans, LinkedIn
                  audits, career plans, mentorship messages, recruiter outreach, talent profile.
                  Created by you in the course of using the product.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Operational data</strong> — auth sessions, audit logs, share-view
                  analytics with hashed visitor identifiers, AI usage counters, error traces.
                  Used for service reliability, abuse prevention, and billing.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                We do not collect special-category data deliberately. Resumes can contain
                religious, ethnic, or health information — we treat the entire document as
                personal data and do not extract those signals for any purpose.

                  To run the AI features (Google Gemini). Your resume / JD / plan text is sent

                  To send transactional emails (sign-up confirmation, password reset, share-link
                  notifications) via Resend. We do not send marketing emails without separate
                  consent.

            <Section title="4. Who we share it with">
              <p>We share data only with the processors listed below, and only to the extent
                needed for that processor to provide its service:</p>
              <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
                <li><strong>Google (Gemini API)</strong> — for AI-generated content.</li>
                <li><strong>Resend</strong> — for transactional email delivery.</li>
                <li><strong>Stripe</strong> — for paid-plan billing.</li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Cloud hosting providers</strong> — to host the database, application,
                  and file storage.

              </ul>
              <p>
                We never sell personal data, never share it with advertisers, and never share it
                with recruiters except where you have explicitly opted into the Talent Pool and
                a recruiter has issued an outreach you accepted.

                <li>Account + content data: until you delete it or your account.</li>
                <li>Operational logs / audit trail: 90 days.</li>

              <p>
                We use TLS for all traffic, encrypted backups, and least-privilege access for
                internal staff. Passwords are stored as bcrypt hashes (we never see your
                plaintext password). Account deletion is irreversible and runs inside a database
                transaction — partial deletes do not occur.
