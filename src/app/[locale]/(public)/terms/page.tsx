                <li>Share your own resumes, reports, and career plans with whomever you like.</li>

              <p>
                Our tools use Google Gemini and similar AI models to draft text, suggest
                bullets, and analyse resumes. <strong>You are responsible for reviewing AI
                output before using it.</strong> AI can produce confident-sounding but incorrect
                claims, especially about specific numbers, dates, employers, and certifications.
                Don&apos;t submit an AI-generated resume to an employer without reading every
                line first.

                <li>
                  Refunds: we refund unused months on annual plans within 14 days of charge, and
                  refund prorated unused days on monthly plans if you cancel within 48 hours of
                  a renewal you didn&apos;t intend.

                the violation is severe (impersonation, mass abuse, payment fraud).
